# The Origin of Money: An Agent-Based Model

Eugene Callahan and Peiwen Tang

## Menger

I. Intro: 
examples of medium of exchange: 
cattle, skins, cubes of tea, slabs of salt, cowrie-shells, *precious metals

II. attempts at solution hitherto:

III. The Problem of the genesis of a Medium of exchange:
exchange just such goods as he directly needs; reject no need at all, or already sufficiently provided.
supply and demand do not quantitatively coincide
different degrees of sale - ableness (Absatzfahigkeit) of commodities.

IV. Commodities as More or Less saleable:
error: definite
*The price at which any one can at pleasure buy a commodity at a given market and a given point of time, 
and the price at which he can dispose of the same at pleasure, are two essentially different magnitudes*
wholesale && retail prices
saleable: facility, diminution
height of saleableness: not the fact that it may be disposed of
at any price whatever -> (all equally saleable)
-> at every moment be easily and surely disposed of at a price corresponding to

V. Concerning the Causes of the Different Degrees of saleableness in Commodities:
circumstances (commodity command a sale):
1. number of persons in want; extent and intensity (unsupplied/constantly recurring)
2. purchasing power
3. available quantity - unsupplied want realation
4. divisibility
5. development of the market (speculation)
6. number of the limitations (regulation)

spatial limits of saleableness:
1. want of the commodities is disturbed in space.
2. goods lend themselves to transport & cost of transport incurred in proportion to their value
3. the means of transport and of commerce generally are
developed with respect to different classes of commodities
4. local extension of organised markets and their inter-communication by “arbitrage”
5. differences in the restrictions imposed upon commercial inter-communication

****time limits
1. permanence in the need of them (their independence of fluctuation in the same).
2. Their durability
3. The cost of preserving and storing them. 
4. The rate of interest.
5. The periodicity of a market for the same.
6. The development of speculation and in particular of time-bargains in connection with the same.
7. The restrictions imposed politically and socially on their
being transferred from one period of time to another.

VI. On the genesis of Media of exchange:
not highly saleable -> exchange
more surely and economically
traffic in space & intervals of time
*These wares would be qualified by their costliness, easy transportability, and fitness for preservation*
in the interest of every one to accept in exchange for his own less saleable goods
those he actually does readily accept.

VII. The Process of Differentiation between Commodities which have become Media of exchange and the rest:
"money" -> increasing their originally high saleableness
brings other wares than money to market -> disadvantage
individual bargainer has no control
forthwith into other goods supplied at that market
Compulsory purchase & sales
difference in salebalness: gradual, certain aspect as something absolute
superiority of the buyer over the seller

VIII. how the Precious Metals Became Money:
limits of the effective desire
wide limits in time and space of the saleableness of the precious metals
unlimited distribution in space of the need for them
low cost of transport

"The proportionately strong, persistent, and omnipresent desire on
the part of the most effective bargainers has gone farther to
exclude prices of the moment, of emergency, of acci- dent, in the
case of the precious metals, than in the case of any other goods
whatever, especially since these, by reason of their costliness,
dura- bility, and easy preservation, had become the most popular
vehicle for hoarding as well as the goods most highly favoured in
commerce.  in the intention of exchanging them subsequently for
other goods directly profitable to him"

production, consumption, and exchange of the precious metals
connected by: intrinsic grounds determining their exchange value

- homogeneity of precious metals
- serve as obligation
- not difficult to recognise
- easily controlled as to quality and weight

IX. Influence of the Sovereign Power:
social
high saleableness

## Our Agent-Based Model

- Each "Menger factor" can be turned on or off.
- We track how many times each good trades.
- A good "becomes money" as it comes close to being 
  one side of every trade.

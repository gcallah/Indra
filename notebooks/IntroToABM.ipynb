    "The first successes of mathematical modeling of reality were in describing *simple orders*. A classic expression of a simple order is Newton's second law of motion, *F* = *ma*: it relates one quantity to only two others, in a very straightforward manner. Similar examples are models for springs, and pendulums, and heat diffusion. Models of simple orders usually take the form of *differential equations*. These types of models were developed extensively in the 18th and 19th centuries, and are still very important today.\n",

But once another planet was allowed to sneak into the system, the possible behavior became far more complex:\n",

    "Well, at least for our solar system, these complexities could (mostly) be ignored. But for other systems this was not the case: as researchers looked into \"far-from-equilibrium\" systems like our weather, or chaotic fluid dynamics, or the behavior of asset markets, they found that these exhibited patterns that could not be captured by models of simple orders, nor models of pure randomness. They were discovering the existence of *complex orders*.\n",

    "The behavior of these orders could not be captured by analysis of a differential equation, nor by statistical procedures. Instead, in general, one creates a model based on some (seemingly) simple rules, and then *runs the model*, and only by doing so does one discover what the system does.\n",
    "\n",
    "A milestone along this path was the discovery, by the mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot, of the *Mandelbrot set*. Mandelbrot took the \"simple\" equation, *f*<sub>*c*</sub>(*z*) = *z*<sup>2</sup> + *c*, where *z* and *c* are complex numbers, and *iterated* it (feeding the result of one iteration into the next), with *z* at the start equal to 0, for *c* near the origin, and found that this seemingly simple equation produced fantastically complex results. In a *simple order*, small differences in the initial value of *c* ought to produce small differences in the final outcome. But Mandelbrot discovered that *extremely* small differences in the initial value of *c* could produce wildly divergent outcomes: this is a characteristic of complex systems: small differences in initial values can produce very big differences in the development of the system. If we color each point *c* by how fast the above equation moves away from the origin, we get a result like [this] (https://youtu.be/0jGaio87u3A)\n",

    "Similar phenomena were discovered in many fields... see the list of applications of ABMs above!... and a new field was opened to science: the study of *complex orders*. In general, we cannot either \"solve\" a problem in such an order by solving a differential equation, as we can for simple orders, or by purely statistical analysis, as we can for random phenomena. Instead, we must specify the rules the parts of the system must follow, and then we must *run the system*, most often on a computer, and see what *emerges*. (Another name for this field of study is *emergent phenomena*.)\n",

    "One of the important tools in exploring this (relatively) new field of complex orders has been *agent-based models*. In such models, instead of trying to find a \"top-down\" equation that we can solve, and therefore say exactly what the model predicts at time *t*, we instead create a number of *agents*, which we program to follow some rules of behavior, and then set those agents \"loose\" in an \"environment\" (our model), and allow them to interact. Such models are also sometimes called *cellular automata*.\n",
